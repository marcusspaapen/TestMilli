-30pages with interactive elements
-3mini games
-Milli is around 5 years old and so are her friends
-First story is about milli gathering different "parts"/abilities, from other animals she meets.
-(optional, takes more time but is a lot more elegant and scales easilly) Basic engine with an editor that works like a string puppet engine thing or keyframe animation. In retrospect, this looks very much possible and desired.


_Story possibilities relevant to Interaction_
-Inventory of different abilities to choose from \\you would not want to get stuck because you are missing an ability
-Unlocking of "levels" with different abilities, when you receive an ability you get to do more stories.
-Sandbox structure, freedom of movement and abilities \\don't make it too messy or complicated (wanda's book)
-Family of friends that sometimes help her in the stories, miro is allways there.
-Different abilities and worlds = Physics!? \\This would be awesome!!!
-Maybe replayability of stories \\can be very complex and open ended which means it will be complicated. On the other hand it can also mean you can re-use ellements/areas.
-Zoom in out mechanic (can be very heavy, unless it's streaming)
-Map should be expandable rel. easy to add pieces/sections (eg. new part in the sky or africa)
-Animation system "a lá machinarium(video game)" for the short introductions inside of the stories.
-Possible 3D!? or at the least paralax in for example the looking around the tree, shadows of spooky area's, branches, etc.
-Sound and audio triggers, on user actions and character actions(time related)


_Editor vs dev dev_
-Basic physics and building blocks that use them.
-Would be nice: easy to add pieces like KSP(video game simulator), editor works like the game. As long as we don't add new interactions to the game it's feasible. Fine tune (stronger or different parameters) but not completely new.
-Different mechanics per world, Underwater(zeroG)/underground(slow moving, dark with tunnels)/tree(branches/multiple levels/wind) so adding a different world is more manageable.
-Many different animals, so many different physics(but hey keep it simple, hà stupid, some/most parts animated‽)
-Box2D is one idea, algodoo for quick prototyping
-Decals system for decorating milli's house and 
-3 little pigs iPad game as an example 

_Ellements/minigames_
-A couple of demos should be working as a proof-of-concept before we go to penguin half of july
-Milli's house is a big playhouse, miro is messing around with the gathered items
-Wanda the Owl looking through her glasses on the world.
-Painting butterflies
-Balancing things on the antlers for as long as possible.
-Example: fireflies you can drag around and illuminate the world
-Text, max 3 lines per page.
-Audio, Wanda has a voice, the rest of the animals make cute little sounds and of course some effects (water/leafs/wind etc.)

_Web_
-At least one of the stories has to be online, but it will probably be a more simplified version (web follows iPad to keep iPad options open)
-3 mini games per story, so also on the web.
-CocosJS or Html5
